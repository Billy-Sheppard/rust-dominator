Example for creating a Chrome extension with dominator.

## How to install

```sh
yarn install
```

## How to build for production

```sh
# Builds the project and places it into the `dist` folder.
yarn build
```

You will then need to open `chrome://extensions` and load the `dist` folder as an unpacked extension.
