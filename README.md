Zero cost declarative DOM library using FRP signals for Rust!

Status
======

It is generally feature complete, though more convenience methods might be added over time.

It is relatively stable: breaking changes are rare, and are handled with the normal semver system.

You must use the Nightly Rust compiler (because it is needed for futures 0.3)

Running the examples
====================

Just do `yarn` and then `yarn start` (it will take a while to compile the dependencies, please be patient)
